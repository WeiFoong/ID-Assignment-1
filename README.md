ID Assignment 1

Design Process:
This website was designed for recruiters that are considering to hire me. This is a portfolio that shows more about me, as well as my achievements, school, experience, as well as projects that I have worked on. My design process while designing this website is that I want it to be easy to navigate and look for information reguarding me, hence there is only one page with all of the information listed out in a organised fashion. The start of the website displays more information about me, so that recruiters will be able to get to know me better, as well as my educational history to show my achievements I obtained in school. By continuing to scroll down, recruiters will be able to see the skills that I possess as well as my work experience. Last but not least, at the bottom of the webpage, there will be an area where I display all of my projects that I have done before as well as a short description about each of them. This is so that recruiters will be able to understand the project that I have done, as well as the technologies used to complete them. 

Features:
Feature 1 - Navigation bar which allows users to navigate different content on the page.
Feature 2 - Back to top button so that users can go back up faster.
Feature 3 - Slideshow to show different pictures of events/activities I attended.
Feature 4 - Hyperlinks to projects and personal webpages to contact
Feature 5 - When hovering over hyperlinks, the colour changes.

Features left to implement:
1) After pressing navigation bar, the bar closes automatically.

Testing:
1.Navigation bar
    - Press the navigation bar to open it
    - Choose the section to go to
    - After looking can press on back to top to return back to top

The project is arranged in row format when it is in desktop view(1920px). However, after reaching around 1535px, it will be quite messed up as the rows do not fill the whole page. After reaching mobile view(480px), it becomes a long page and the content is arranged in columns.
A problem that I encountered while doing is that my images for the slideshow is unable to be placed in a file as whenever I did, it was not able to detect the images in the files and no image would come out. (not addressed yet)
