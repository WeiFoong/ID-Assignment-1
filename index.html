                <h1 class="heading" id="top"> About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a confident and social guy with an outgoing
                    personality. My patience, thoughtfulness and good
                    manners make me popular among my peers. Being mature and sensible, I can be counted on to make
                    sound
                    decisions and carry out assigned tasks responsibly and efficiently. I am also able to withstand
                    pressure and remain undaunted by setbacks. In addition, I am also a very active person who
                    enjoys
                    doing all kinds of sports. This has helped me learn to work well with my peers as well as not to
                    give up easily. </p>
                <h1 class="heading">Values</h1>
                <p> I am a person that strongly believes in respect for others as well as integrity. This is because
                    my school and parents taught me a lot about mutual respect and its importance.<br>
                    Other than respect, I also believe that integrity is very important as it can determine ones
                    character
                    and how trustworthy one is. </p>
                <h1 class="heading">Interests</h1>
                <p>One of my hobby is playing basketball with my friends. Even though many of us
                    are in different schools now, we will always try to make time to meet up and play basketball
                    together
                    whenver we are free.<br>
                    Other than basketball, I also enjoy playing computer games such as "League of
                    Legends" and "Valorant" with my friends. Since these games are online, we usually call each
                    other
                    and play together every night.</p>

                <h3>Ngee Ann Polytechnic | School of ICT | Diploma in IT</h3>
                <p>By using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I was able to make a static front-end responsive resume for
                    my
                    first assignment in Interactive Design. This website gives more information about me as a
                    person,
                    and what I have learnt throughout
                    my time in school.</p>

                <h2>2nd Project</h2>
                <h3>Ngee Ann Polytechnic | School of ICT | Diploma in IT</h3>
                <p>By using what I learnt in Programming 1, I was able to make a game called "Simp City". A game
                    that
                    makes use of my python knowledge that I learnt in my first semester of school.</p>
